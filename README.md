# COE241-Project
This repository is built to store and share the code and files for our COE241: Microcontrollers course. In this project, we have developed an automated traffic light system using a microcontroller, on the MPLAB X IDE, in C language. In this course, we have used the micro-controller PIC24FJ128GA010.
