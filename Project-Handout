Design a traffic lights junction connected to Port A LEDâ€™s that operates based on two modes controlled by PortD Push buttons. 
If:
RD13= ON, then traffic lights work in normal mode based on a sequence along with time delay.
RD6=ON, then the traffic lights works in flash mode where GN and RD flash with appropriate delay.

Input Modes of Operation (PTH):
RD13- Normal Mode based on a pre- determined sequence along with appropriate time delay.
RD6- Flash mode where GN and RD flash  with delay.

Traffic Lights
The PIC24F board features a clear mimic of a cross roads junction controlled by two pairs of traffic lights on the NS and EW directions as shown in Fig(1).
